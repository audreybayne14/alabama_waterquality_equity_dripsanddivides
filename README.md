The abstract for this research project was accepted to the 2024 National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR). 

## Introduction

Disparities in water quality often disproportionately affect marginalized communities, highlighting environmental justice concerns. This study investigates the relationship between demographic factors and water quality violations in Alabama. By analyzing demographic data alongside water quality violation records, we aim to identify patterns and disparities in water quality regulation and enforcement, with the ultimate goal of informing targeted interventions to address environmental inequalities and promote equitable access to clean and safe drinking water.

## Objective

The objective of this study is to examine the association between demographic characteristics and water quality violations in Alabama counties. Specifically, we aim to:
- Identify demographic factors, such as race, income, and education, that may be associated with higher rates of water quality violations.
- Assess the spatial distribution of water quality violations and demographic characteristics across Alabama counties.
- Investigate potential disparities in water quality regulation and enforcement based on demographic factors.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Demographic data, including race, income, and education levels, were obtained from census sources. Water quality violation records were obtained from regulatory agencies.
2. **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and water quality violation data. Spatial analysis techniques, including geographic information system (GIS) mapping, were employed to visualize the spatial distribution of water quality violations and demographic characteristics.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between demographic factors and water quality violations. Statistical significance was determined based on p-values.
All data was imported, cleaned, and organized using Microsoft Excel and Power Query. Python (with packages Pandas, Geopandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy) was used to perform statistical analysis and create visualizations.

## Analysis

- Demographic factors, such as race, income, and education levels, were analyzed for each county.
- Water quality violations were quantified as violations per capita.
- Spatial analysis techniques were used to visualize the spatial distribution of demographic characteristics and water quality violations.

  ## Results/Findings

- Positive correlations were observed between certain demographic factors, such as percentage of people of color and percentage of people with low income, with water quality violations per capita.
- No statistically significant correlation was found between the percentage of people with less than a high school education and water quality violations per capita.
- Geographic visualization revealed spatial patterns of demographic characteristics and water quality violations, highlighting areas with higher concentrations of violations and vulnerable populations.

## Conclusion

The findings of this study suggest that demographic factors may play a significant role in shaping disparities in water quality regulation and enforcement. Addressing environmental justice concerns requires targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities and ensuring equitable access to clean and safe drinking water for all communities. Future research should explore additional factors influencing water quality violations and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving environmental justice and public health outcomes.
